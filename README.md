This is my first individual project, therefore, the code is still quite rudimentary. All the information and variables
that I used are veridic. In addition, if you want to use this project or build your own on top of it, you only have to 
change the variables to the bank and country you choose. This is completely theoretical and in no way this is linked or affiliated to the 
Santander Bank. 
If you find any error, or anything that could be optimized, please let me know. I'll be happy to listen to any tip on
coding, finance, or whatever!

Thanks for visiting!
